Perry is the father that, you just referenced whose, whose oldest, is graduating from preschool tomorrow and she's got a little cap and gown and we're excited to catch some pictures from that. It's an exciting time. It's, it's crazy how, how fast time goes. I'm sure even crazier for, for Perry and his wife Sari, another great friend of ours, a great friend of the show too. Perry's gonna come on for the first time. Ray's back. if you're a longer time listener, we had Ray on after the election to get his thoughts, about the, the Trump victory and why he was excited. And one of the reasons that Ray was excited was that, Trump was bringing his crew with him, chiefly Elon Musk. And when all of this started going down, the, the, I trust that anyone that listens knows what this is, right, what I'm talking about, is last Friday, almost a week ago, this relationship imploded, exploded all, all over the place, and I reached out to you being , \"I wonder if Ray and/or Perry would be interested in coming on to talk,\" because both of them are big, big Donald guys, big Elon guys, and I was curious that they hear their perspectives. And for various reasons, some of it scheduling, trying to wrangle all four of our schedules, and, and some of it just not wanna react in the moment, Ricky, I knew that Trump was going to bury this story because the headlines were negative, over the weekend. I didn't know how he was going to bury it, but he- he's found a way. And as the week progressed and we were , oh, do we still want to have this conversation now that it's almost a week later and it seems to be off the front pages and out of the news cycle because things happen quickly in this news cycle. but I still think it's worth having. I still think there are deeper questions to ask and deeper conversations to have about what this means for the future of this administration over the next three and a half years and also for the broader MAGA movement and for the Republican Party in general, and very eager to hear Ray and Perry's perspectives on that, I'm excited to, to bring them on in a little bit.",

Ray, Perry, and I were college roommates in Trinity, this should be a fun discussion. We scheduled this ostensibly to talk about the-. Trump, Musk blow up and the de- deterioration and the reconciliation such as it exists in their relationship, and we'll, we will start there.

The country is better when the two of them are together. the last time I was on here, I talked about how I loved the fact that Elon was in Trump's corner, and I believe that everything that Elon has done, has been for the betterment of our country. I think, what broke them apart was, they're both in the right, which is a cop out to say. I know that and, people can get annoyed at me for that. but I think what. Trump trying to pass majority of it, and then what Elon also was annoyed about was, raising the bar of what we're spending. And I'm a big believer in lowering the spending of the government, I- I get where he's coming from. we can get into how the bills are, actually put forth and all that, but it- it.

I. if, if I talked about one - and I've had private conversations with you, Brian, about this late night - but if I have one existential crisis for the United States, it's, it's our spending. we have a trillion dollars in interest expense annually this year, a trillion dollars. We're putting forth bills that are gonna continue to put massive deficits on an annualized basis. we still have a blended debt basis where we're paying two and a half, 3%. That debt is gonna be refied at something significantly more north of that. I think a lot of the. What the CBO estimates and stuff are predicated on a. on a, a debt balance of 3. 6%, our 30-year treasury now is almost 5%. It's going to add hundreds of billions of dollars of annual interest expense, and we'll continue to spend. So, there's a point where the country just goes into a debt spiral, and, I think people just think that , \"We can just continue to print money,\" and, the Fed will all be there to back it, and Treasury will continue to do what they need to do.
